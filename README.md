Welcome to my Enote-System. This is my final Q1 project in Trinity. This project allows you to take notes, edit them, and even create new ones.
If you want to give it a try first download the requirements.txt
Then open the project in visual studio code and type cd Enotes_system in the terminal window
Finally run the project by typing python manage.py runserver
